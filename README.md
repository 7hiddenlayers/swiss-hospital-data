Swiss Hospital Data
---

This is a collaborative effort to establish a common data set about Swiss public medical infrastructure, where the community can contribute and manage data in a moderated way. Our goal is to improve the transparency and efficiency of data exchange about basic indicators, expanding on the existing available open government data.

This project was started at the [Monitoring COVID-19 effects](https://db.schoolofdata.ch/event/7#top) (#covid19mon) hackathon. Visit our [challenge page](https://db.schoolofdata.ch/project/68) for further details and tasks, some of which are in our current notes and [backed up here](NOTES.md). Please suggest additional data sources and ideas in the [issue tracker](issues).

:package: View the crowdsourced [Data Package](https://github.com/schoolofdata-ch/swiss-hospital-data/#data) and OGD [Data Schema](https://github.com/openZH/covid19_hospitalinfra) to check the data baseline.

# Data

There is an initial Data Package which can be [previewed here](https://data.okfn.org/tools/view?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fschoolofdata-ch%2Fswiss-hospital-data%2Fmaster%2Fdatapackage.json).

Please see the [data](data/) folder to see all the datasets that we are working on. 

> *Instructions: Accessible data files (ideally in simple data formats such as [CSV](https://frictionlessdata.io/guides/csv/), [JSON](http://json-schema.org/specification.html) and [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/)), as well as the raw data, are placed in the `data` folder. In this section you should mention the files and formats included. It is good to suggest purposes for this data, such as example applications or use cases. Include any relevant background, contact points, and links that may help people to use this data. You can find examples of this at [datahub.io](https://datahub.io) or [github.com/datasets](https://github.com/datasets), and further tips at [frictionlessdata.io](https://frictionlessdata.io/guides/data-package/) and [datahub.io](https://datahub.io/docs/data-packages/publish-faq)*.

# Preparation

Details of what data we are using and how we are preparing it can be found in our [notes](NOTES.md).
