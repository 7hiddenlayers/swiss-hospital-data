Swiss Hospital Data
---

This is a collaborative effort to establish a common data set where the community can contribute data in a moderated way.

We started with a Google sheet, which was cleaned up using OpenRefine, and then further aggregated in the `shc_data` R script here, and we are now working on a [schema proposal](https://github.com/openZH/covid19_hospitalinfra) with the Canton of ZÃ¼rich as well as continuing work on a Data Package to be used as basis for further analysis and visualization.

This project was started at the [Monitoring COVID-19 effects](https://db.schoolofdata.ch/event/7#top) (#covid19mon) hackathon.

In this section you should mention the files and formats included. It is good to suggest purposes for this data, such as example applications or use cases. Include any relevant background, contact points, and links that may help people to use this data. You can find examples of this at [datahub.io](https://datahub.io) or [github.com/datasets](https://github.com/datasets), and further tips at [frictionlessdata.io](https://frictionlessdata.io/guides/data-package/) and [datahub.io](https://datahub.io/docs/data-packages/publish-faq)*.
